This website combines the use of Philips Hue lights and the Pomodoro study method to create a system that aids with producitve and healthy studying. The system will automatically use the lights to indicate when to take a break. When the light is purple it is time to study, when the light goes red it is time to take a break, after indication from the user in the form of a button press, the light will go yellow to show itâ€™s break time. When the light goes red it's work time and the user again acknowledges this through a button press. At any point the user can press a button to take a spontaneous break the light will go into break mode by turning yellow. Every 5 breaks the user will be given a longer break twice the length of a regular break. At the end of the study session the light will go white to show the time set is complete. The system also makes use of JSON files to store and read data for saving user's preferred settings.
